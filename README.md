# splat-modpack
Designed for multiplayer, Splat's Modpack is a modpack that aims to add minimal features, with primarily optimization mods included. It also includes mods for forming teams, including [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) and [Open Parties and Claims](https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims). This modpack also contains mods from [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop), as well as qol mods, such as [AppleSkin](https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin) and [Xaero's Minimap (fair play)](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap-fair).

## Server Usage
Since this modpack was designed for clients (with the server having a slightly different set of mods), it might not work on a server. If you plan on using this pack on a server, I would recommend removing the client-side mods from the modpack. 

## Shaders
This modpack includes some shaders, off by default
